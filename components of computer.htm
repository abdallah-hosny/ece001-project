<p>The main components of a Computer Systemâ€™s Architecture and their functional flow are as below,</p>

<ol>

  <li>input unit</li>

  <li>processing unit</li>

  <li>output unit</li>

</ol>

<p>Though these components are capable of working independently, in order to make the computer system to give accurate outcomes, it is important for these components to function in harmony with one another. There are many devices qualified as both input and output units for the computer systems.</p>
