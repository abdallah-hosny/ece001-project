<p>To become a computer architect, often called a computer network architect, the candidate must have at least a bachelorâ€™s degree in computer science, engineering, information systems, or a related field. The best programs for aspiring computer architects are computer-based fields because they offer students the most hands-on experience in database design or network security, both of which are important for computer architects. These classes also teach the students various technologies used in different networks.</p>
